# cra-template-snapshot

A simple Snapshot + Routes template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Usage

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template snapshot
```

## Features

This template aims to provide a simple solution for small react-apps that need static pages generation and improved SEO, without complex configuration. It is ideal for simple business sites and small applications.
It manages to do that with the use of [react-snapshot](https://github.com/geelen/react-snapshot), [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) and [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet). The template also uses [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) and [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages).

Using this template you get:

- Improved SEO
- Routing
- Out-of-the box sass and scss support
- Static exporting on build.
- Gh-pages deployment (To serve your files on Github, you may have to configure your gh-pages branch. Check [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for more information)

## Alternatives

If your application needs complex static exporting, you might want to look at [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
